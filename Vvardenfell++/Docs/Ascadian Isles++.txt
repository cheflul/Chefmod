Ascadian Isles++

This mod is an upgraded version of the vanilla Ascadian Isles+ using assets from Tamriel_Data. It aims to be a minor region overhaul that still remains vanilla design friendly, as well as adding certain common items from the Mainland that might feel missing after playing a lot of Tamriel Rebuilt. The ++ series will be more intrusive with interior edits on top of the region overhaul, and potentially less compatible than vanilla+ as a result.

	I might not do anything here
	
There will be no Ascadian Isles++ Vivec, the level of changes for that would be out of scope for this little region overhaul, and there are many other choices if you want a vivec mod that you could play. Pickles and I might do our own Vivec++ in the distant future but I wouldn't count on it.
